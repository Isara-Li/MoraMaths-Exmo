    <h1>An Artistic Exploration of Simple Harmonic Motion with Python Turtle</h1>
    <div>
    <h2 class="panel-sticky">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to a mesmerizing journey into the realm of simple harmonic motion, artistically brought to life with Python Turtle graphics. In this blog post, we will delve into a captivating code that illustrates the beauty of oscillatory systems through dynamic animations and colorful visuals. By blending the elegance of physics with the creativity of programming art, we embark on a captivating exploration of simple harmonic motion.

   <div>
    <h2 class="panel-sticky">The Visual Setup</h2>
    <p>The code begins by initializing the Turtle window, setting its dimensions, and painting a soothing light pink rectangle at the bottom to represent water. The scene is set with a yellow square representing the spring and a gray square representing the mass. The visual elements come together against a sleek black background, creating an aesthetically pleasing canvas.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <h2 class="panel-sticky">Animating the Harmonic Motion</h2>
    <p>The heart of the code lies in the implementation of simple harmonic motion. The spring-mass system oscillates gracefully, governed by mathematical equations that drive its position, velocity, and acceleration over time. As the program runs, you will witness the mass elegantly moving up and down in a harmonic dance, with the spring adjusting its length to maintain equilibrium.

    <div>
    <h2 class="panel-sticky">Real-time Data Display</h2>
    <p>Intriguing insights into the motion are provided through real-time data display. At the bottom of the window, you can observe the instantaneous position (y), velocity (Vy), and acceleration (Ay) of the mass as it undergoes harmonic oscillation. This feature adds an educational aspect to the artistic animation, helping you comprehend the underlying physics principles.
    </p>
